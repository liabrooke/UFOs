# UFOs
## Overview of Analysis
### Purpose
###### Dana, a journalist, enlists our help in covering an article about her hometown. This town is famous for its UFO sightings & annual UFO-enthusiasts gatherings. She needs our help deciphering a JavaScript file which contains UFO sightings from all over the world. We will help her put the findings in a nice table and webpage that will be published.
### Results
###### When using the new webpage, the user has the ability to search for UFO sightings by various criteria - date, city, state, country, and/or shape. Not all criteria have to be used in a search though, any number / combination can be used. A user just needs to input a value to one (or more) of these options and if any data matches the inputted values, the table will show only that data.

### Summary
###### A drawback of this new design is that it's not clear that not all search criteria have to be used. If I first looked at the page as the user, I would think I had to have all that information, which might be overwhelming. If it had a description of how to use the webpage, or maybe a dropdown of cities to pick from, states to pick from, etc, that might be easier for the user (much more advanced though).

###### My table does not work, I went back through the module & my code multiple times & I'm not sure where it went wrong. The page just refreshes but no data shows, I am still working on it. Also, the "app_1" and "index_1" files are the work from the module, not the challenge.
